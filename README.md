#Contribution:
Quicker Repo is used for the base setup

The following changes have been made to the base repo:
Code for Training Adaptive Alpha Lookahead optimizer on NLP Tasks: nlp-lookahead/Quixer/quixer/setup_training_adaptive_alpha.py

The code is to be run in general since Adaptive Alpha Lookahead Optimizer is just a optimizer it can be easily replaced by any of the other methods
